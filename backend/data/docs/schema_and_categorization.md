# Firestore Schema & Categorization Logic

## ðŸ”§ Firestore Document Structure

```
users (collection)
â””â”€â”€ {userId} (document)
    â””â”€â”€ transactions (subcollection)
        â””â”€â”€ {transactionId}
            â”œâ”€â”€ amount: double
            â”œâ”€â”€ category: string
            â”œâ”€â”€ merchant: string
            â”œâ”€â”€ description: string
            â”œâ”€â”€ date: timestamp
```

## ðŸ§  Categorization Logic

1. Each transaction is matched against a list of keywords under predefined categories.
2. Keyword match is case-insensitive and checks merchant string.
3. If no match is found, transaction is marked as `"Uncategorized"`.

## ðŸ§ª Testing

Tested using mock transactions and verified category assignment for known merchants:

- Starbucks â†’ Food
- Uber â†’ Transport
- Amazon â†’ Shopping
